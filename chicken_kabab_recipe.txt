Ingredients

    4 teaspoons Maida All purpose flour /
    2 teaspoons Cornflour
    2 teaspoons Red chilli powder
    2 teaspoons Ginger garlic paste
    2 Eggs
    1 teaspoon Cumin powder
    2 teaspoons Garam masala
    1 teaspoon Coriander powder
    2 2 lime Juice of
    2 Green chili
    1/4 teaspoon Red food colouring
    Salt
    1 kilogram Chicken with bones
    Oil for deep frying

Method

    Ingredients:

    4 tbsp maida/ all purpose flour

    2 tbsp cornstarch/cornflour

    2 tbsp red chili powder

    2 tbsp ginger garlic paste

    2 eggs

    1 tbsp cumin powder

    2 tsp garam masala

    1 tsp coriander powder

    Juice of 2 limes (or to taste)

    3 green chilies, finely chopped

    1/4 tsp red food colour,optional (I used it)

    Salt to taste

    1 kg chicken, with bones

    Oil for deep frying

    None

    ✔In a bowl, whisk together all the ingredients from maida to salt. Add a few extra drops of water if the batter is very thick.

    ✔ Add the chicken pieces and mix to coat well. Let it marinate, covered, in the fridge for 3-4 hours.

    ✔ Heat oil on high heat, in a deep vessel. Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the chicken pieces, a few pieces at a time.

    ✔ Fry for 3-4 mins turning the pieces occasionally. If you fry it further, the colour of the coating will change from red to brown, if you used food colour.

    ✔Drain on paper towels and serve hot with a few lime wedges & onions rings

    Notes:

    Add a tsp of rice flour if desired for extra crispiness, and garnish it with whatever texture of your choice.

    When frying do not reduce the heat to very low because the chicken coating will get soggy at the same time frying in very high heat will give you partially uncooked chicken which you wouldn’t want.
